# Joe's Resume

It's not enough to put together my resume in some google doc and export as a pdf, I need to make it a project that includes an API service and a front end framework to render the details.

For now, I'm relying on a very simple TypeScript + Express.js driven API service ([birddog](https://github.com/smokinjoe/birddog)) to provide the data necessary for my resume to render at, https://react-resume-v2.fly.dev/resume

I hope you enjoy!
